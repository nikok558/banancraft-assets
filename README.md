# BananCraft Assets

This repository hosts official resources (sounds, music, and icons) for the **BananCraft** launcher.

## Purpose
These files are used by the `LegacyAssetManager` to restore original Alpha and Beta Minecraft sounds. Since Mojang's original S3 servers are no longer active, this repository serves as a reliable mirror for the community.

## Content
- `beta_sounds.zip` - A complete collection of legacy sounds (including the classic "Oof", old door sounds, and footstep audio) sourced from Web Archive.

## Disclaimer
All assets are the property of Mojang Studios / Microsoft. This repository is for archival and compatibility purposes for the BananCraft launcher only.
